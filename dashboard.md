In an effort to support planning and response efforts to the recent Corona Virus outbreak,
the [Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/nssac)
division of the [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) 
at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) has prepared a visualization tool that provides a complementary perspective to 
[2019-nCoV Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
We hope this tool will encourage researchers world-wide to explore the surveillance datasets 
being made available by [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/new_list.shtml), and [DXY](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia), and curated by [JHU](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/). 
Using the [2019-nCoV Surveillance Dashboard](http://ncov.bii.virginia.edu/dashboard/), researchers can:
- View all incidence data, filtered by date and data range
- View heatmap of disease prevalence on an interactive map 
- Query data based on topics of interest 
- **Select neighboring regions based on user selection**
- Export subsets of the data for analysis on external tools 
 
The current version of the tool is a beta release; we will be providing updates on the tool as well as to the datasets. 
Please report any suggestions, bug reports, or additional data sources you think we should consider 
by contacting nssac_ncov_support at virginia.edu.

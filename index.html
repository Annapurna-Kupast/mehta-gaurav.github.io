2019-nCoV Surveillance Dashboard

In an effort to support planning and response efforts to the recent Corona Virus outbreak, the Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC) division of the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia has prepared a visualization tool that provides a complementary perspective to 2019-nCoV Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE. We hope this tool will encourage researchers world-wide to explore the surveillance datasets being made available by WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, and DXY, and curated by JHU. Using the 2019-nCoV Surveillance Dashboard, researchers can:

View all incidence data, filtered by date
View heatmaps of disease prevalence on an interactive map
Select and query data based on topics of interest
Export subsets of the data for analysis on external tools
The current version of the tool is a beta release; we will be providing updates on the tool as well as to the datasets. Please report any suggestions, bug reports, or additional data sources you think we should consider by contacting nssac_ncov_support at virginia.edu.
